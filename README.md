# gh-actions

According to official [doc](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onworkflow_dispatch).
When using the workflow_dispatch event, you can optionally specify inputs that are passed to the workflow.
This trigger only receives events when the workflow file is on the default branch.

This repo is gh actions playbround, because I don't want random commtis in the product repository just to develop a new pipeline
